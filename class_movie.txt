// The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

//     title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
//     studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
//     rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

// a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

class Movie {
      constructor(title, studio, rating){
            this.title = title;
            this.studio = studio;
            this.rating = rating;
      }
      getmoviedet(){
            return `Movie name ${this.title}, Studio name ${this.studio}, Rating of ${this.rating}`
      }
}

// // b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

class Movie {
      constructor(title, studio){
            this.title = title;
            this.studio = studio;
            this.rating = "PG";
      }
}

// // d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

const mov = new Movie("Casino Royale", "Eon Productions", "PG­-13");
